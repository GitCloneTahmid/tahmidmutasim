<h1><u>The art of being confused.</u></h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Tahmid, and if there’s one word to sum up my current state of being, it’s confused. I’m like a traveler standing at the crossroads of life, with too many roads to take but no map to follow. One day I dream of building a business empire, the next I envision a quiet life among the hills, living in harmony with nature. Then there’s the pull of engineering—creating something tangible, solving real-world problems. But wait, what about trading? The thrill of market fluctuations and mastering financial strategies keeps calling me too. It’s chaos, to say the least.

My head is spinning in all directions, and it’s not getting any better. Recently, while scrolling aimlessly through Reddit, I came across a user who shared that her comfort film was Kapoor & Sons. I thought, Why not give it a watch? Little did I know that this movie would trigger a whole new layer of confusion. It hit me in ways I didn’t expect. Suddenly, I found myself daydreaming about writing—crafting stories, novels, maybe even screenplays. I could picture myself sitting in some café, lost in thought, typing away as words flow effortlessly onto the page. Who knows? Maybe I could even write something as moving as Kapoor & Sons one day.

To add to this whirlwind, I recently went through a breakup with someone I genuinely thought I loved. I ended it, not because I wanted to, but because my mind is all over the place. How could I commit to someone when I don’t even know where I’m headed in life? The uncertainty was suffocating, and it made me question everything.

But here’s the thing—I don’t want to stay stuck in this endless loop of indecision. Life is happening around me, and I need to figure it out. Or maybe, just maybe, I don’t. Maybe the key is to embrace the confusion for a while and see where it takes me.</p>
